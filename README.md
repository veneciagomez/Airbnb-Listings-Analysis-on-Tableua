# Airbnb Data Visualization Project

## Overview
This project leverages Tableau to analyze Airbnb listing data, focusing on pricing trends, listing distributions, and revenue generation over time. The dataset includes information on the number of bedrooms, zip codes, prices, and weekly revenue data. The visualizations provide insights into how different factors impact Airbnb listing prices and revenues.

## Visualizations

### 1. Avg Airbnb Price by Number of Bedrooms

This bar chart visualizes how the average Airbnb price increases with the number of bedrooms. Listings with six bedrooms have the highest average price, while one-bedroom listings have the lowest.

### 2. Distribution of Listings by Number of Bedrooms

This table shows the distribution of Airbnb listings based on the number of bedrooms. One-bedroom listings are the most common, while six-bedroom listings are the least.

### 3. Avg Price per Zipcode

This bar chart represents the average Airbnb price for listings across different zip codes. It highlights how Airbnb prices vary depending on location, showing higher average prices in some zip codes compared to others.

### 4. Revenue by Year (Split by Week)

This line graph shows Airbnb revenue over the course of a year, split up by weeks. It highlights fluctuations in revenue, allowing you to identify peak and low booking periods throughout the year.
